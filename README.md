## PagarMe Opencart integration test

# Using this as your base
 - If you want to use this as a scaffold to your project, yuo can, but remember
  The config.php and /admin/config.php should be modified accordingly -
  1 - Change the database. The database displayed here is for test purposes only and could be "hacked" any minute ;)
  2 - Change the site roots. Unless you wanna call you site 'opencart-yay2.herokuapp.com'. I'm open for selling the name, if you wish ;)
  3 - Profit
