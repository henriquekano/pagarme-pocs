## PagarMe Opencart integration test

# Using this as your base
If you want to use this as a scaffold to your project, yuo can, but remember to change the files config.php and /admin/config.php accordingly:
 - Change the database. The database displayed here is for test purposes only and could be "hacked" any minute ;)
 - Change the site roots. Unless you wanna call you site 'opencart-yay2.herokuapp.com'. I'm open for selling the name, if you wish ;)
 - Profit
